In this tutorial we will code from scratch some of the basic concepts that are needed for a working cryptocurrency. The angle is always to implement things in the most simplest way.

The project that we will build in this tutorial is called "Naivecoin". The programming language is [Typescript][typescript]. The Naivecoin is in some terms an extension to the [Naivechain - blockchain in 200 lines of code][naivechain].

The final version of Naivecoin is by no means a "production ready" implementation of a cryptocurrency, but rather tries to show that the basic principles in a cryptocurrency can be implemented in a concise way.

 I hope this tutorial will help you understand more of the technical ascpects of a cryptocurrency.
